# Recession-Analysis
Introduction
This tool is designed to analyze the economic performance of a country by examining quarterly data, focusing on indicators like GDP growth, unemployment rates, and consumer spending. The dataset used for this analysis is specific to the monthly GDP growth rate of the United Kingdom.

Recession Analysis
Recessions are identified as periods marked by two consecutive quarters of reduced money circulation, primarily measured through negative GDP growth. The tool visually represents these recessions with a red line in contrast to the overall trend in GDP growth, depicted by a green line.

Severity Assessment
The severity of a recession is a key aspect analyzed by the tool. Severity is defined by the depth and duration of the economic contraction during a recession. A more severe recession indicates a more prolonged and profound decline in economic activity, impacting employment, incomes, and various economic indicators.

Code Logic
The code determines the occurrence of a tough economic period by evaluating negative growth in both the current quarter and the preceding one. The analysis extends to examine the duration (Recession Duration) and severity (Recession Severity) of these challenging periods, providing a comprehensive understanding of economic fluctuations over time.
